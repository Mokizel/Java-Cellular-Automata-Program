# Java-Cellular-Automata-Program
A 2D Cellular Automata simulation made in Java. The program has a start and stop feature in it.

Feel free to use this program for whatever you want; commercially or for personal projects. This is a implementation of a program made
in the 1970's called 'The Game of Life'. Despite its name, it is a simulation. The rules of the simulation are pretty basic and easy to
understand. 

Rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
